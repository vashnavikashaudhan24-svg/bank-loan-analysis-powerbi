# 🏦 Bank Loan Performance Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Showcase



---

### 🎯 Project Objective

This project aims to provide a comprehensive, interactive dashboard for a bank's loan portfolio, enabling stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze loan status, and effectively manage risk by differentiating between *Good Loans* and *Bad Loans*.

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Power BI Desktop* | Used for data modeling, designing interactive visualizations, and creating complex DAX calculations for MTD/MoM variance. |
| *SQL* | Used for robust data transformation, creating derived tables, and ensuring data integrity before loading into Power BI. |
| *Microsoft Excel* | Served as the foundational data source for initial data storage, cleaning, and preliminary structuring. |

### ✨ Key Metrics & Highlights

| KPI | Value | MoM Growth | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Total Loan Applications* | *38.6K* | 6.9% | Strong month-over-month growth in application volume. |
| *Total Funded Amount* | *$435.8M* | 13.0% | Indicates high capital deployment. |
| *Average Interest Rate* | *12.0%* | 3.5% | Useful for benchmarking loan profitability. |
| *Good Loan %* | *86.2%* | N/A | High ratio, indicating effective credit assessment processes. |
| *Bad Loan %* | *13.8%* | N/A | Focus area for collection strategies and policy review. |

### ❌ Problems Addressed

* *Risk Identification:* Quickly identifying the segments (e.g., specific states, grades, or purposes) contributing most to the 13.8% Bad Loan volume.
* *Performance Tracking:* Providing dynamic MTD (Month-to-Date) and MoM (Month-over-Month) tracking for all core financial KPIs.
* *Data Fragmentation:* Integrating data from multiple sources (Excel, SQL) into a single, unified, and interactive view for better decision-making.

### 🗺 Walkthrough of Key Visuals

The dashboard is structured into three main views: *Summary, **Overview, and **Details*.

* *Summary View:* Presents the primary KPIs, and the critical Good vs. Bad Loan breakdown with respective funded and received amounts. It also features a Loan Status table (Current, Charged Off, Fully Paid).
* *Overview View:* Shows trend analysis (Total Applications by Month), geographical distribution (Total Applications by State), and key distribution metrics (Employee Length, Purpose, Home Ownership).
* *Details View:* Provides granular, row-level data for individual loan IDs, including Loan Purpose, Home Ownership status, Issue Date, and Installment details.

### 📈 Impact

This dashboard provides the bank with an *Actionable Reporting Tool* that leads to:

1.  *Improved Portfolio Health:* By focusing collections efforts on high-risk Bad Loan segments.
2.  *Strategic Lending Decisions:* By identifying profitable loan purposes (e.g., 'car' loans vs. 'debt consolidation') and geographies.
3.  *Efficiency:* Eliminating manual reporting and offering real-time performance insights.
